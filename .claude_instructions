# WHS Portal Project Instructions

## Project Context
This is a Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) portal for Cook Shire Council in Queensland, Australia. The portal is being developed using Plone 6.1 Content Management Framework as a Classic site.

**Project Structure:**
The WHSPortal project consists of multiple independent repositories housed in a common workspace directory (`/home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/`):

- `csc/` - **csc.whs** (v0.9.20): Core WHS incident & hazard management addon [git: main branch]
- `csc.whstheme/` - **cook.whs.barceloneta** (v1.0.27): Custom theme with button-grid folder navigation [git: main branch]
- `csc.teams/` - **csc.teams**: Team listing addon with LDAP integration [git: main branch]
- `whs-content-import-tools/` - Content migration utilities (not a Plone addon) [git: main branch]

## Environment Details

### Development Server (whsportaldev)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 VM on local network
- **Access**: SSH as cscadmin user (key-based authentication configured)
- **Hostname**: whsportaldev

1. **Always provide clear, direct answers** - No vague responses
2. **Include step-by-step explanations** of reasoning and approach
3. **Critically review proposals** against best practices for the subject matter
4. **State clearly when something won't work** and explain why
5. **Provide practical action plans** with clear implementation steps
6. **Break down broad questions** into manageable parts

### Expertise Level
- Act as a domain expert (software developer, ICT manager, system administrator as appropriate)
- Apply deep reasoning at full capacity
- Validate conclusions against best practices and external references
- Consider constraints of small-to-medium local government IT operations

### Technical Approach
- Prioritize Plone 6.1 Classic site conventions and best practices
- Consider security implications (cyber security role separation in place)
- Account for small team constraints and maintainability
- Validate against Plone documentation and community standards

## Git Repository Structure

**IMPORTANT**: The WHSPortal workspace is NOT a single git repository. Each component is independently version-controlled:

### Active Repositories (each with own git)

1. **csc/** - [git repository]
   - Package: `csc.whs` (currently v0.10.27, profile v19)
   - Purpose: Core WHS incident & hazard reporting and management
   - **Content Types**:
     - `csc.whs.incident` - Workplace incidents with injury/damage (reporting view: `/@@report-incident`)
     - `csc.whs.hazard` - Workplace hazards and risks (reporting view: `/@@report-hazard`)
   - Features: Dexterity content types, custom browser views, workflows, LDAP integration, GPS mapping, 5×5 risk matrix, email notifications, custom folder listings, interactive SVG body map
   - Built from: `pyproject.toml`
   - Recent: v0.10.27 Phase B Complete - Form enhancements, emergency services tracking, print view, validation improvements

2. **csc.whstheme/** - [git repository]
   - Package: `cook.whs.barceloneta` (v1.0.27)
   - Purpose: Custom Barceloneta theme extension
   - Features: Button-grid folder navigation, 12-color palette, file display in folders, LDAP member properties
   - Built from: `pyproject.toml`

3. **csc.teams/** - [git repository]
   - Package: `csc.teams` (v1.0.x)
   - Purpose: Team listing with LDAP integration
   - Features: User picker, auto-display of AD properties, flexible display options
   - Built from: `pyproject.toml`

4. **whs-content-import-tools/** - [git repository]
   - NOT a Plone addon - standalone Python tools
   - Purpose: Automated content migration from filesystem to Plone
   - Features: AI metadata extraction (Claude), collective.exportimport integration, 100% extraction success rate
   - Phase 5 status: Content import complete (8/8 batches + 8 new files prepared)
   - Repository: https://github.com/Cook-Shire-Council/whs-content-import-tools

5. **whsportal-deployment/** - [git repository] (Project Root)
   - Infrastructure repository for deployment scripts, configs, and documentation
   - Contains: `deploy-systemd.sh`, `sudoers.d-plone`, `plone.service`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `.claude_instructions`
   - Created: 2025-10-13
   - Repository: https://github.com/Cook-Shire-Council/whsportal-deployment

### Virtual Environment Location
- **Location**: `/home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/venv` (project root)
- **Purpose**: Shared virtual environment for all tools (import scripts, utilities)
- **Activation**: `source /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/venv/bin/activate`
- **Important**: whs-content-import-tools uses the PROJECT ROOT venv, not a local one
- **Libraries**: anthropic, docx2txt, openpyxl, python-pptx, etc.

## Development Workflow

### Automated Deployment (Current Method)
Use `deploy-systemd.sh` script for automated build-deploy-restart cycle:

```bash
# Deploy individual addons
./deploy-systemd.sh csc          # Deploy csc.whs only
./deploy-systemd.sh theme        # Deploy cook.whs.barceloneta only
./deploy-systemd.sh both         # Deploy both addons
```

**Script performs:**
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Builds wheel from pyproject.toml
3. Copies wheel to whsportaldev via SSH
4. Installs with pip --force-reinstall --no-deps
5. Restarts Plone via systemd (`sudo systemctl restart plone`)
6. Clears nginx cache
7. Verifies service is active and provides status

**Plone Instance Management (systemd):**
- Plone runs as systemd service: `plone.service`
- Check status: `ssh whsportaldev 'sudo systemctl status plone'`
- View logs: `ssh whsportaldev 'sudo journalctl -u plone -f'`
- Manual restart: `ssh whsportaldev 'sudo systemctl restart plone'`
- Log file: `/opt/plone/instance/var/log/instance.log`

**Prerequisites:**
- Systemd service configured (via `setup-systemd.sh`)
- Sudoers configured for passwordless `systemctl restart plone`

### Why Wheel Deployment
- Tests actual packaging (production-like)
- Proper version management
- Clean, repeatable process
- Catches packaging errors early
- Professional deployment method

### Vocabulary and Schema Changes
When updating Python code (vocabularies, schemas):
- No special upgrade step needed
- Changes are loaded at Plone startup
- Simply deploy with `./deploy-systemd.sh csc`
- Systemd restart automatically loads new code

## Git Workflow

### Committing Changes
Standard git workflow for local commits:

```bash
# Check status
cd /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/csc  # or other repo
git status

# Stage changes
git add -A  # or specific files

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Pushing to GitHub (Using GitHub CLI)
**Preferred method:** Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authentication and pushing:

```bash
# Push to remote (after committing)
cd /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/csc  # or other repo
gh repo sync  # Syncs current branch with remote

# OR use standard git push (gh handles authentication)
git push
```

**Important notes:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the standard method for this project
- Each repository (csc/, csc.whstheme/, csc.teams/, whs-content-import-tools/, project root) is independent
- Always push from within the specific repository directory
- Check remote status: `gh repo view --web` (opens GitHub in browser)

### Common Git Operations

```bash
# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check what will be pushed
git log origin/main..HEAD

# View commit details
git show <commit-hash>

# Check remote status
git remote -v
gh repo view
```

## Development Standards
- Follow Plone addon development best practices
- Maintain clean separation between theme and functionality
- Consider Australian local government context and requirements
- Prioritize workplace health and safety use cases

## AI-Assisted Development Tracking

**IMPORTANT**: When implementing features or changes documented in implementation plans, track actual development time vs estimated time:

### Time Tracking Protocol
1. **At Start of Work Session**: Note the start time for the implementation task
2. **During Implementation**: Track time spent on each phase/component
3. **At Completion**: Calculate total actual time spent (your time + AI coding time)
4. **Record in PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Update the relevant section with:
   - **Estimated Time**: From the implementation plan
   - **Actual Time**: Total collaborative development time
   - **Breakdown**: Time split between planning, coding, testing, deployment
   - **Productivity Gain**: Calculate efficiency improvement percentage

### Example Recording Format
```
**Implementation Metrics (AI-Assisted):**
- Estimated Time: 8-10 hours (traditional development)
- Actual Time: 3.5 hours total
  - Planning/Review: 0.5 hours
  - Coding (AI-assisted): 1.5 hours
  - Testing: 1.0 hours
  - Deployment: 0.5 hours
- Productivity Gain: 65-71% time savings
- AI Contribution: Automated code generation, schema updates, template modifications
```

### Purpose
This tracking enables Cook Shire Council to:
- Quantify productivity improvements from AI-assisted development
- Build accurate estimates for future AI-assisted projects
- Demonstrate ROI of AI collaboration to stakeholders
- Identify which development phases benefit most from AI assistance

### Where to Record
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Add time tracking metrics to each phase/version entry
- **WHSOfficer_Requests.md**: Update individual request entries with actual vs estimated time
- **Session Summary**: Include brief time summary in "Recent Session Work" sections
