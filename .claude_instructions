# WHS Portal Project Instructions

## Project Context
This is a Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) portal for Cook Shire Council in Queensland, Australia. The portal is being developed using Plone 6.1 Content Management Framework as a Classic site.

**Project Structure:**
The WHSPortal project consists of multiple independent repositories housed in a common workspace directory (`/home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/`):

- `csc/` - **csc.whs** (v0.9.20): Core WHS incident & hazard management addon [git: main branch]
- `csc.whstheme/` - **cook.whs.barceloneta** (v1.0.27): Custom theme with button-grid folder navigation [git: main branch]
- `csc.teams/` - **csc.teams**: Team listing addon with LDAP integration [git: main branch]
- `whs-content-import-tools/` - Content migration utilities (not a Plone addon) [git: main branch]

## Environment Details

### Development Server (whsportaldev)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 VM on local network
- **Access**: SSH as cscadmin user (key-based authentication configured)
- **Hostname**: whsportaldev
- **Plone Instance Path**: `/opt/plone`
- **Virtual Environment**: `/opt/plone/venv`
- **Start Command**: `/opt/plone/venv/bin/runwsgi -v /opt/plone/instance/etc/zope.ini`
- **Deployment Model**: Single instance running in screen session for direct console output
- **Reverse Proxy**: nginx at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/whsportal.cook.qld.gov.au`
- **Public URL**: https://whsportal.cook.qld.gov.au
- **User Access**: WHS Office staff provide feedback via public URL

### Local Development
- **OS**: Ubuntu VM on laptop (current session environment)
- **Purpose**: Code editing and development (cyber security role separation)
- **Sync Method**: SSH-based rsync to whsportaldev

### Team
- **Team Size**: 5 IT staff supporting 180 organizational staff
- **Role**: Manager of Information and Communication
- **Stakeholder**: WHS Office (provides requirements and feedback)

## Development Preferences

### Response Style
1. **Always provide clear, direct answers** - No vague responses
2. **Include step-by-step explanations** of reasoning and approach
3. **Critically review proposals** against best practices for the subject matter
4. **State clearly when something won't work** and explain why
5. **Provide practical action plans** with clear implementation steps
6. **Break down broad questions** into manageable parts

### Expertise Level
- Act as a domain expert (software developer, ICT manager, system administrator as appropriate)
- Apply deep reasoning at full capacity
- Validate conclusions against best practices and external references
- Consider constraints of small-to-medium local government IT operations

### Technical Approach
- Prioritize Plone 6.1 Classic site conventions and best practices
- Consider security implications (cyber security role separation in place)
- Account for small team constraints and maintainability
- Validate against Plone documentation and community standards

## Git Repository Structure

**IMPORTANT**: The WHSPortal workspace is NOT a single git repository. Each component is independently version-controlled:

### Active Repositories (each with own git)

1. **csc/** - [git repository]
   - Package: `csc.whs` (currently v0.9.20, profile v16)
   - Purpose: Core WHS incident & hazard reporting and management
   - Features: Incident/hazard content types, workflows, LDAP integration, GPS mapping, 5Ã—5 risk matrix, email notifications, custom folder listings
   - Built from: `pyproject.toml`
   - Recent: v0.9.18-0.9.20 added custom folder listing views

2. **csc.whstheme/** - [git repository]
   - Package: `cook.whs.barceloneta` (v1.0.27)
   - Purpose: Custom Barceloneta theme extension
   - Features: Button-grid folder navigation, 12-color palette, file display in folders, LDAP member properties
   - Built from: `pyproject.toml`

3. **csc.teams/** - [git repository]
   - Package: `csc.teams` (v1.0.x)
   - Purpose: Team listing with LDAP integration
   - Features: User picker, auto-display of AD properties, flexible display options
   - Built from: `pyproject.toml`

4. **whs-content-import-tools/** - [git repository]
   - NOT a Plone addon - standalone Python tools
   - Purpose: Automated content migration from filesystem to Plone
   - Features: AI metadata extraction (Claude), collective.exportimport integration, 100% extraction success rate
   - Phase 5 status: Content import complete (8/8 batches + 8 new files prepared)
   - Repository: https://github.com/Cook-Shire-Council/whs-content-import-tools

5. **whsportal-deployment/** - [git repository] (Project Root)
   - Infrastructure repository for deployment scripts, configs, and documentation
   - Contains: `deploy-systemd.sh`, `sudoers.d-plone`, `plone.service`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `.claude_instructions`
   - Created: 2025-10-13
   - Repository: https://github.com/Cook-Shire-Council/whsportal-deployment

### Virtual Environment Location
- **Location**: `/home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/venv` (project root)
- **Purpose**: Shared virtual environment for all tools (import scripts, utilities)
- **Activation**: `source /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/venv/bin/activate`
- **Important**: whs-content-import-tools uses the PROJECT ROOT venv, not a local one
- **Libraries**: anthropic, docx2txt, openpyxl, python-pptx, etc.

## Development Workflow

### Automated Deployment (Current Method)
Use `deploy.sh` script for automated build-deploy-restart cycle:

```bash
# Deploy individual addons
./deploy.sh csc          # Deploy csc.whs only
./deploy.sh theme        # Deploy cook.whs.barceloneta only
./deploy.sh both         # Deploy both addons

# Deploy without restarting
./deploy.sh csc --no-restart
```

**Script performs:**
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Builds wheel from pyproject.toml
3. Copies wheel to whsportaldev via SSH
4. Installs with pip --force-reinstall --no-deps
5. Optionally restarts Plone instance
6. Provides verification of installation

**Plone Instance Management:**
- Instance runs in screen session named 'plone'
- View logs: `ssh whsportaldev 'screen -r plone'`
- Manual restart: Ctrl+C in screen, then run start command
- Log file: `/opt/plone/instance/var/log/instance.log`

### Why Wheel Deployment
- Tests actual packaging (production-like)
- Proper version management
- Clean, repeatable process
- Catches packaging errors early
- Professional deployment method

## Development Standards
- Follow Plone addon development best practices
- Maintain clean separation between theme and functionality
- Consider Australian local government context and requirements
- Prioritize workplace health and safety use cases

## Quick Start Guide for New Work Sessions

When starting work on the WHSPortal project, check these files in order:

1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** (project root) - Current version (v0.9.20), demo readiness, recent changes
2. **This file** (.claude_instructions) - Development workflow and project structure
3. **csc/README.md** - csc.whs addon features and version history
4. **Git status in addon directories** - Check for uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/csc && git status
   cd /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/csc.whstheme && git status
   cd /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/csc.teams && git status
   cd /home/ceo/Development/WHSPortal/whs-content-import-tools && git status
   ```
