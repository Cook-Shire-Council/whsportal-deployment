## Technical Challenges Resolved

### Challenge 1: Content Type Not Registered
**Issue:** After v10 upgrade, hazard content type wasn't appearing in Add menu.
**Root Cause:** Upgrade step didn't import GenericSetup profile components.
**Solution:** Modified upgrade step to explicitly call `setup.runImportStepFromProfile()` for typeinfo, workflows, catalog, and registry.
**Fixed In:** v0.9.4 (upgrade v10 → v11)

### Challenge 2: Invalid Property in Type XML
**Issue:** Upgrade v11 failed with `ValueError: undefined property 'auto_view'`
**Root Cause:** Hazard type XML contained invalid `auto_view` property (Plone 5 holdover).
**Solution:** Simplified hazard type XML to match incident type (removed all invalid properties).
**Fixed In:** v0.9.5 (upgrade v11 → v12)

### Challenge 3: Hazard Not in Add Menu
**Issue:** Even after successful registration, "Hazard Report" didn't appear in Add menu.
**Root Cause:** Folder type didn't have `csc.whs.hazard` in `allowed_content_types`.
**Solution:** Updated `types/Folder.xml` to add hazard to allowed content types.
**Fixed In:** v0.9.6 (upgrade v12 → v13)

### Challenge 4: Form Scroll Behavior
**Issue:** "Next Section" button scrolled to bottom of section instead of top.
**Root Cause:** `scrollIntoView()` called while CSS transition still animating.
**Solution:** Replaced with `window.scrollTo()` using absolute positioning, increased timeout to 600ms.
**Fixed In:** v0.9.1 (both incident and hazard forms)

### Challenge 5: Browser Caching
**Issue:** JavaScript updates not appearing after deployment.
**Root Cause:** Browser caching old JavaScript files.
**Solution:** Cache-busting URLs with version parameter (?v=X), instructed users to hard refresh.
**Status:** Documented in deployment process

### Challenge 6: Deployment Script Complexity
**Issue:** Interactive prompts slowing down deployment workflow.
**Root Cause:** Script asked for restart confirmation every time.
**Solution:** Removed `--no-restart` flag and interactive prompts, now always auto-restarts.
**Fixed In:** Updated deploy.sh script

## Next Steps - Post-Implementation

### Documentation
1. ✅ Update HAZARD_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (this document)
2. ⏳ Review and update hazard_implementation_plan.md with "COMPLETE" markers
3. ⏳ Update .claude_instructions with hazard system information
4. ⏳ Create user documentation for WHS Officers
5. ⏳ Document deployment process and upgrade path

### Version Control
1. ⏳ Review all changes with `git status`
2. ⏳ Commit changes to csc.whs addon
3. ⏳ Tag release as v0.9.6
4. ⏳ Push to GitHub repository
5. ⏳ Update deploy.sh in separate commit

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)
- Consider custom hazard display view (currently using default Dexterity view)
- Add hazard search/listing page for WHS Officers
- Add hazard statistics dashboard
- Create reports/exports for hazard data
- Add bulk hazard import functionality

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental deployment strategy** - Deploy often, test often
2. **Reusing existing patterns** - LDAP, maps, progressive sections all worked first try
3. **Proper upgrade step structure** - Explicit profile imports prevented issues
4. **Version control** - Easy to roll back when needed
5. **Testing on dev first** - Caught all issues before production

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Initial upgrade step** - Should have included profile imports from the start
2. **Type XML validation** - Should have validated against Plone 6 schema before deploying
3. **Folder constraints** - Should have checked allowed_content_types earlier
4. **Documentation timing** - Should update docs immediately after each phase
5. **Browser cache** - Need better cache-busting strategy for static resources

### Best Practices Established
1. **Always use deploy.sh script** - Never manual scp/pip commands
2. **Test upgrades thoroughly** - Check logs after every upgrade step
3. **Verify in UI immediately** - Don't assume success, actually test
4. **Keep upgrade steps focused** - One specific fix per upgrade version
5. **Auto-restart on deploy** - Removes friction from deployment workflow
