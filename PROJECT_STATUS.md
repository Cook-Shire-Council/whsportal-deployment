### Recent Major Fixes (October 12, 2025)

#### 1. Reference Code URL Implementation
**Issue:** Content IDs were generated from titles, causing potential conflicts
**Solution:** Generate reference code BEFORE content creation and use as ID parameter
**Impact:** Clean, unique, predictable URLs; perfect for cross-system tracking
**Files:** `browser/intake.py`, `browser/hazard_intake.py`

#### 2. Catalog Indexing Error
**Issue:** `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'method'`
**Root Cause:** Catalog indexing methods with same names as schema fields
**Solution:** Removed ALL indexing methods from `content/incident.py`
**Reason:** Dexterity automatically handles catalog indexing for schema fields
**Impact:** Fixed authenticated incident submission, cleaner code

#### 3. Hazard View Template
**Issue:** No custom view for hazard content type
**Solution:** Created complete hazard.pt template based on incident.pt
**Features:** Risk matrix visualization, GPS maps, photo galleries
**Challenge:** TAL template quote escaping in risk matrix
**Resolution:** Changed to CSS class-based conditional styling

#### 4. Deployment Automation
**Enhancement:** Automated nginx cache clearing after deployments
**Files:** `deploy-systemd.sh`, `sudoers.d-plone`
**Benefit:** Ensures users always see latest code after deployment

#### 5. Custom Folder Listing Views (v0.9.18-0.9.20)
**Issue:** Default Plone folder view not optimized for WHS Officer workflows
**Solution:** Created custom listing views with WHS-relevant columns and sorting
**Features:**
- Incidents: Date occurred, person involved, severity badges, workflow state
- Hazards: Risk rating badges with emojis, smart risk-based sorting, location display
- Color-coded severity/risk indicators for quick visual assessment
- Mobile-responsive table design with overflow scrolling
- Action buttons for reporting new incidents/hazards
**Files:** `browser/incident_listing.py`, `browser/hazard_listing.py`, templates
**Upgrade Path:** v16 upgrade step automatically registers views as available display options
**Result:** WHS Officers can quickly scan and prioritize incidents/hazards at a glance

### Phase 1 Security Enhancements (October 16, 2025)

#### Anonymous Form Protection (v0.10.17)
**Goal:** Protect anonymous incident and hazard forms from abuse while maintaining zero friction for legitimate users.

**Security Implementation:**
1. **Honeypot Fields (Bot Detection)**
   - 3 hidden form fields that legitimate users can't see but bots will fill
   - Fields: `contact_number`, `website`, `accept_terms`
   - Silent rejection - bots receive fake success response without revealing detection
   - Added to both `report_incident.pt` and `report_hazard.pt` templates

2. **IP-Based Rate Limiting**
   - Conservative limits: Incidents (3/hour, 10/day, 30/month), Hazards (5/hour, 15/day, 50/month)
   - ZODB persistent storage (no external database required)
   - Proxy-aware IP detection (X-Forwarded-For header support)
   - User-friendly error pages with WHS Office contact information
   - Admin override capability for false positives

3. **Duplicate Detection**
   - SHA256 content fingerprinting of key form fields
   - 60-minute detection window
   - Prevents accidental duplicate submissions
   - Friendly message suggesting to wait or contact WHS Office

**Design Principles:**
- **Fail-Open Approach:** If security checks error, allow submission (safety-critical system priority)
- **Anonymous-Only:** Authenticated users bypass all security checks
- **Silent Bot Detection:** Don't reveal detection to attackers
- **Zero Friction:** No CAPTCHA or additional steps for legitimate users
- **User-Friendly Errors:** Clear instructions with WHS Office contact info

**Files Modified:**
- **New File:** `src/csc/whs/security.py` (428 lines) - Core security module
- **Modified:** `src/csc/whs/browser/intake.py` - Added security integration
- **Modified:** `src/csc/whs/browser/hazard_intake.py` - Added security integration
- **Modified:** `src/csc/whs/browser/templates/report_incident.pt` - Added honeypot fields
- **Modified:** `src/csc/whs/browser/templates/report_hazard.pt` - Added honeypot fields
- **Version:** `pyproject.toml` updated from 0.10.16 to 0.10.17

**Deployment Status:**
- ‚úÖ Security module created with comprehensive functionality
- ‚úÖ Honeypot fields integrated into both forms

### CSV Export Feature Implementation (October 20, 2025)

#### Incident & Hazard Listing Display Enhancements (v0.10.18.7 ‚Üí v0.10.19)
**Goal:** Add CSV export functionality to incident and hazard folder listing views for WHS Officer reporting and analysis.

**Implementation Status: ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE**

**Phase 1: CSV Export Functionality**
- Added `export_csv()` method to `IncidentListingView` class (133 lines)
  - Exports all incidents with comprehensive field set (31 columns)
  - Australian date format (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM)
  - UTF-8 BOM for Excel compatibility
  - Timestamp-based filenames (incidents_export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv)
  - Department name resolution from vocabulary tokens
  - Incident type display names (not tokens)
  - Workflow state human-readable labels

**Bug Fixes (During CSV Export Testing):**
1. **TypeError: 'str' object is not callable (line 303)**
   - **Issue:** `get_state_title(obj)` expected brain object, but received content object in CSV export
   - **Root Cause:** Brain objects have `review_state` attribute, content objects need workflow tool
   - **Solution:** Added inline workflow state resolution using `portal_workflow` tool
   - **Files Fixed:** `incident_listing.py` (lines 405-418), `hazard_listing.py` (lines 336-349)

2. **Last Modified showing method object repr**
   - **Issue:** CSV showing `<bound method DexterityContent.modified of <Hazard at /whsportal/hazards/HAZ-2025-00005>>`
   - **Root Cause:** `modified` is a method, not a property - using `getattr()` returned method object
   - **Solution:** Changed to `obj.modified()` to call the method
   - **Files Fixed:** `incident_listing.py` (line 462), `hazard_listing.py` (line 376)

**Files Modified (Phase 1):**
1. `src/csc/whs/browser/incident_listing.py` - Added export_csv() method + bug fixes
2. `src/csc/whs/browser/hazard_listing.py` - Added export_csv() method + bug fixes

### Phase C: Critical Bug Fixes & Notifiable Incident Planning (October 21-23, 2025)

#### Multi-Select Field Bug Fix (v0.10.28 ‚Üí v0.10.40)
**Goal:** Fix critical bug where "Notifiable to Regulator" field was not being set correctly when multiple incident types were selected.

**Problem Description:**
- When user selected both "FAI" and "Notifiable Incident" checkboxes in Q8 (Incident Types), server only received first value: `['fai']`
- Expected behavior: Server should receive both values `['fai', 'notifiable']` and automatically set `notifiable_to_regulator = True`
- Single selection (only "Notifiable Incident") worked correctly
- Multi-selection failed consistently

**Root Cause Identified:**
- **Browser correctly sent both values** using FormData API: `['fai', 'notifiable']`
- **Zope automatically strips `:list` suffix** from form field names (e.g., `incident_types:list` becomes `incident_types`)
- **Code was checking for wrong field name**: Looking for `'incident_types:list'` which didn't exist after Zope processing
- **Fallback used `_first()` helper**: Helper function deliberately returns only first value from lists (line 62-63 in intake.py)

**Debug Process (v0.10.28-v0.10.39):**
- v0.10.28-0.10.37: Initial investigation and attempted fixes
- v0.10.38: Added conditional debug logging (didn't appear)
- v0.10.39: Comprehensive unconditional debug logging revealed root cause
- Debug output showed:
  ```
  DEBUG: Found incident_type field: 'incident_types'
  DEBUG:   request.form['incident_types'] = ['fai', 'notifiable'] (type: <class 'list'>)
  DEBUG:   data['incident_types'] = ['fai', 'notifiable'] (type: <class 'list'>)
  ```

**Solution Implemented (v0.10.40):**
1. **Fixed field name check** (intake.py lines 755-773)
   - Changed to check for `'incident_types'` directly (WITHOUT `:list` suffix)
   - Zope had already stripped the suffix and converted to Python list
   - Added fallback check for `'incident_types:list'` for legacy compatibility

2. **Removed field from `_first()` fallback**
   - Removed `'incident_types'` from the list of alternative field names
   - Prevents fallback from returning only first value

3. **Code change:**
   ```python
   # First check for the field WITHOUT :list suffix (Zope strips it)
   if 'incident_types' in data:
       incident_types = data.get('incident_types')
       # Ensure it's a list
       if not isinstance(incident_types, (list, tuple)):
           incident_types = [incident_types] if incident_types else []
       logger.debug(f"Got incident_types from data (Zope auto-converted): {incident_types}")

#### Notifiable Incidents Enhancement Planning (v0.10.40)

**Context:**
Following the successful bug fix, user identified critical compliance requirements for notifiable incidents under Queensland's Work Health and Safety Act 2011.

**User Feedback:**
- "Notifiable to Regulator" field should be at TOP of incident view (legal compliance information)
- Need visual indicators in listing view (count, highlighting)
- Recommended: Separate workflow states for notifiable incidents
- Workflow proposal: Auto-transition to "Notifiable - Pending Review" state when notifiable = True
- Review/confirmation step with downgrade option if incorrectly classified

**Expert Analysis Provided:**
- Queensland WHS Act 2011 requires **immediate notification** to WorkSafe QLD (phone: 1300 369 915)
